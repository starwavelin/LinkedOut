School Project: Use Java Servlet, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript to develop a simplified version of LinkedIn, with basic endorsing logic implemented. 

Initially, this project is done by my teammate and me in the windows environment. Here, I am rewriting this project myself using PostgreSQL 9.3 and Eclipse 3.8 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

The original design proposal of this project can be found here.

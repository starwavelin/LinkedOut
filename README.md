School Project: Use Java Servlet, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript to develop a simplified version of LinkedIn, with basic endorsing logic implemented. 

Initially, this project was done by my teammate and me in the windows environment. At that time, I focused on the part of the table creation, writing the 7 SQL queries and parts of Java Servlet; my teammate focused on the part of Java Servlet, query for Question Number 2 , and Bootstrap CSS, as illustrated in this original [design proposal](http://www.starwavelin.com/docs/linkedoutReport.pdf).

Now, I am rewriting this project all myself using PostgreSQL 9.3 and Eclipse 3.8 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. And, all the version control processes are done by Git command line instead of using GitHub Client.

library used: postgresql-9.3-1100.jdbc4.jar
